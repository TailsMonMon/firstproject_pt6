# firstproject_pt6
Part five of ''first thing ever in C#''.

I'm trying to learn C#, hoping to be able to write mods for games, but also because I want to work as a system developer. I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAvhe6oe-_4&index=5&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvRX6xK1oi0reKci6ignjdSa

I'm at 13:45 in the video and I'm not sure what will happend next with this project. 
I've just started a class, "Programming 1" so I'll work on that rather than this, ofcourse.
